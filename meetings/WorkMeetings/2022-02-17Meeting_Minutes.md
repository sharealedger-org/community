The Sharealedger Meeting minutes from the weekly work meeting.  Attendees included:
- Sandy Peresie
- Niel Beesley
- Jon DeLashmit
- Kip Twitchell
- Mike Hopkins (briefly)

Reviewed the prior week's meeting, noting the end result was that considering a shared google sheet as a simple shared ledger, with the provisios that:
- No one can update any row of data.  New rows have to be added to the sheet
- There needs to be a column for sign-off of all parties to the row before it is considered recorded
- There would need to be hidden columns of data, for each party's privately associated data.

Access to the system could look like "Locking down an excel spreadsheet" and something like a facebook "friend request".

We also reviewed the prior weeks' meeting discussion about who are the customers of Sharealedger.  This question created two impressions:
- There are tool developers that are the immediate customers of sharealedger, learning how to share ledgers and build apps to do so.
- Then they have customers that are the end users of those apps. 
Some portion of this work includes:
- Growing Support
- Development
- Recruiting Users

Jon Suggested the things to be developed include:
- Vision
- High level Road map
- Detailed Road Map - Agile waypoints (MVPs)
- Recuitment

Jon asked "How would we define a Shared Ledger?"  Kip pointed him to this link on the website for a potential [vision statement](https://sharealedger.org/?p=244)

Transition to that vision may not be an easy thing.  Start ups may be one area we look for participants.  Also Government is interesting. They could require their vendors to to report into a specific system.

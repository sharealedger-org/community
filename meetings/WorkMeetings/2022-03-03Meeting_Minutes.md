# Vision Statement
Small changes made in the vision statement based upon the developed goals. Each goal should link to something in the mission statement

>The Sharealedger Vision is to improve measurement of performance (either financial or otherwise) as expressed in [“Vision for a New Financial World,”](https://sharealedger.org/?p=244) by promoting innovation through a community, enabling building a common library of concepts and software for shared bookkeeping including business events, structured data and positions, at lower cost and higher scale than today’s systems to facilitate widespread adoption

# Potential Goals

1. Test the concept of shared ledgers to prove they provide better data quality at lower costs than today financial systems (not just blockchain).
2. Create an engaged and talented community to promote innovation in financial systems based upon the proof.  
3. Develop and support methods and approaches to shared ledger, and if needed open source component for use in reinvigorating financial systems with observable impact.
4.  Nuture and grow an ecosystem adoption of the shared ledger solutions using the methods, approaches and shared software.

We have noted the order of the goals is important.  If goal number one is not achieved, the remaining goals will be meaningless.

Also, Jon suggested the website might be organized in some manner around headings for each goal.  I suggested I could see goal 1 (Test Shared Ledger Concept) and goal 3 (Develop Methods) being headings.  An About page on the menu may be adequate for goals 2 (Community) and a starting place for now about goal 4 (ecosystem).

# Next Steps
We had some discussion on how things would be measureable or observable.

To progress, Jon suggested perhaps we do factors involved in each goal.  And perhaps starting with goal 1, as all other goals are dependent upon number one.

An obstacle for item 1 can be the cost of conversion verses testing if a shared ledger provides the benefits hypothesized. 

Another obstacle can be measurement of today's world in monetary terms, vs. cost in time, or lost opportunities.  

Next week's meeting will include focus on goal 1.

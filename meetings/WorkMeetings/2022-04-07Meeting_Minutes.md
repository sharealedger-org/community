## Vision Statement
The group agreed today we had completed our vision statement sessions, and we were ready to get more tactical.

## RSC Commerce
Ade suggested it is time to doubled down on the ides of Really Simple Commerce.  The blog video can be found here: [Simple Financial System Proof of Concept](https://ledgerlearning.com/2019/12/13/simple-financial-system-proof-of-concept/)  See the [video]((https://youtu.be/_pAhvTEbZf4)) at the bottom of the blog post. 

This led to the Jon pointing out that what was needed was a story, with multiple entry points perhaps, that help people understand the idea of RSC and a shared ledger, and its power.  

We agreed to work on a script to begin with for a video that would tell the story.  Kip is to give Jon a draft version of the script by next Thursday.

Jon also agreed to provide a draft write-up of the Vision sessions for posting on activity on Sharealedger.

Kip noted he will be busy the next two weeks, and so all interaction will be off-line.

Meeting adjourned after 40 minutes.

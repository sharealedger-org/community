# Participant Needs
Some discussion held about what are the types of people we need to further the goals of the organization.

Notes that there is a sequential nature to the goals of the organization.  That focused the discussion on goal 1: "Test the concept of shared ledgers to prove they provide better data quality at lower costs than today financial systems (not just blockchain)."

Neil noted that Standards can drive some level of adoption.  Jon gave this link about standards https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png

Kip suggested the graphic at this page is the more simple statement of why goal 1 needs to be understood and prove:  http://ledgerlearning.com/2019/02/04/blockchain-gap-trust-and-efficiency/  

Agreement that sensing what the likely subject area is for the study would help us find the right people.

# Website Structure

Kip suggested that the goals provide some basis for organization of the website.

Jon suggested the following be considered:  From a high level, (1) who is going to the website, (2) what to those people want,  (3) what do you want to tell them in addition to what they are looking for, and (4) how do do this and not innundate the audience.

Start each page start with 5-8 bulleted lines, have a link on the end of each line to say (learn more)

Have 3 levels of detail for each point, to allow the audience to choose the depth of information they are prepared for

# Restatement of Vision Statement
Small changes made in the vision statement based upon the developed goals. Each goal should link to something in the mission statement

>Sharealedger's Vision is (1) to improve of performance measurement (either financial or otherwise) as expressed in [“Vision for a New Financial World,”](https://sharealedger.org/?p=244) (2) by promoting innovation through a community, (3) enabling a common library of concepts and software for shared bookkeeping, (4) and facilitating widespread adoption through lower cost and higher scale than today’s existing systems

1. Test the concept of shared ledgers to prove they provide better data quality at lower costs than today financial systems (not just blockchain).
2. Create an engaged and talented community to promote innovation in financial systems based upon the proof.  
3. Develop and support methods and approaches to shared ledger, and if needed open source component for use in reinvigorating financial systems with observable impact.
4.  Nuture and grow an ecosystem adoption of the shared ledger solutions using the methods, approaches and shared software.

# Next Steps
Start to update the website.

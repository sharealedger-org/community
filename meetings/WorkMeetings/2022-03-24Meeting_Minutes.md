## Vision Discussion
The meeting began a bit early, with Ade joining.  Ade helped turn the discussion from the prior week on empirically  proving shared ledger value to a broader question of the benefit to society, and the difficulty in tracing the many indirect costs of today's systems to the source of ledgers.  This included the impact of not having a consistent ledger, not the cost of ledgers.  

There was some discussion of philanthropy as a possible goal, but noting while it is a good motivator but not a universal motivator.  Ade also noted more immediately goals that can be more easily linked to easier motivators:  Money, legacy, power/influence/authority, progress/innovation, philanthropy

Jon noted, "I am still not sure what our value statement is (Other than "isn't this interesting?")" and "It would be a neat exercise to think about the cascading impact of realizing SharedLedger."  This led to comments about "Compliance, Visibility in investments, reduced fees..." and revisiting the sharealedger vision statement.

We reviewed the linked article "visions for a financial world, and embedded much of the preamble in the new visions statement/

## Vision
A restatement of the vision:

Shared ledgers provide transparency, consistency, and accessibility to transform the financial world and will bring one billion new people into the digital economy; not just through transaction payments and receipts, but also through measurement of what they do well, what they don’t do well, and what they should do differently to prepare for the future. To accomplish this, Sharealedger.org must (1) develop the community to (2) innovate truly shared ledgers, (3) curate a library of shared resources for bookkeeping, (4) and facilitate adoption by lower cost and fewer constraints than today’s existing systems

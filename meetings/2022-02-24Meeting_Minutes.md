# Opening  
Reviewed last week's meeting minutes, and reviewed the Slack Channel workspace for Sharealedger.

Discussion started about a loyalty point programs, and what would a shared ledger bring to that problem.

# Vision Statement
Discussion shifted to considering the vision, goals, factors we control, and tasks to influence those factors.

An initial vision statement was drafted for consideration:

The Sharealedger Vision is to enable ubiquitous measurement of performance (either financial or otherwise) as expressed in [“Vision for a New Financial World,”](https://sharealedger.org/?p=244) by building a common library of concepts and software for shared bookkeeping including business events, structured data and positions, at lower cost and higher scale than today’s systems to widespread facilitate adoption

We discussed a simple framework for understanding the problem of bookkeeping, including these ideas from historical accounting:

- Daybook.  The first book of bookkeeping is the book in which contracts, receipts, shipping documents and other originating documents are kept to track activities.  
  - It is Chronologically organized, 
  - Captures Business
  - Often Unstructured Data
- Journal.  The second book of bookkeeping, containing structured data views of the Daybook.
  - Chronological
  - Structured Data
  - Standardized
- Ledger.  The third book of bookkeeping, containing positions (balances) by categorized data in the journal
  - Non-chronological
  - By category
  - Position
  - Structured Data over time

We agreed to continue to refine this vision statement in next week's meeting.

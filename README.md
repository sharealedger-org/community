The Sharealedger project is a collaborative, open source effort, to share information and discuss ideas about improving ledgers of all kinds.  The Shareledger GitHub organization holds multiple repositories, some of which are POC/prototyping in nature.  Others in the future may contain elements shared with those who wish to share a ledger.
